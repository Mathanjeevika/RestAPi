<h3>
    What is HTML ?
</h3>

<p>
Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the foundation of website and web 
application development. It allows you to ensure that your content is 
understood by both segments of your audience: the people who watch, 
read, or listen to your content, and the computers that display it. 
</p>

<p>
In this course, learn how to craft excellent HTML with the pieces that 
HTML itself has to offer. Instructor Jen Simmons highlights all of the 
fundamental concepts you need to use HTML thoughtfully. She focuses on 
semantic markup: tagging content as what it is, and not just for 
formatting, convention, or convenience. 
</p>

<p>
This has far-reaching impact for those who consume the web differently; 
it ensures that when a screen reader or a system (like a search engine) 
consumes a page, it knows exactly what it contains and how to categorize 
that information.
